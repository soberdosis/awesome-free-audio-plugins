But we realized that what most people liked about the plugin was not the multiband phase shift but the extreme resonance that we added as a bonus to sculpt the sound around the filters cross over frequency. So when we decided to develop Binvert further we began to develop that part of the plugin.  The result is a versatile tool that you can use either as we originally intended, extreme bass drum sounds or for a subtle boost in the low-end while mastering.           | ✅         | ✅             | ✅           | [Binvert](https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/3-Studio-Tools/72-Utility/2692-Binvert)                                                                                             |

It measure the correlation between frequencies in the spectrum and warn you if the amount of low end exceed what’s known to sound good. This is not a exact knowledge and the situations where Evouyn will give you a warning  even though the amount of low end is perfectly fine are many. Even so, in most music produced today the correlation between parts of the spectrum can be predicted and with the help of little math you can calculate the approximate percentage that most probably sound good. | ✅         | ✅             | ✅           | [Evouyn](https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/3-Studio-Tools/79-Metering/1509-Evouyn)                                                                                              |

A good blanaced mix/master should survive all the way to ‘Default’ with just a little increase in harshness. If you find your mix too harsh halfway through you’ll have to go back to the mix/master and use EQ, MB compression or other tools to soften it a bit. Remember to put the plugin at ‘Flat’, bypass it or remove it before bounce your new mix/master.                                                                                                                                                            | ✅         | ✅             | ✅           | [Fletchy Muncher](https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/3-Studio-Tools/72-Utility/2600-Fletchy-Muncher)                                                                             |

That is music where you put a bass drum on all fours, techno, house, trance, minimal, tribal and so on. Put Lazy Kenneth on the bassline track and it will automatically duck the signal when the bass drum hits. You could place a LK on all tracks except the bass drum for some real heavy pumping effect.                                                                                                                                            | ✅         | ✅             | ✅           | [Lazy Kenneth](https://www.pluginboutique.com/product/3-Studio-Tools/71-Dynamic-Processor/1631-Lazy-Kenneth)                                                                         |
